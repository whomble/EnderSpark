# WireEDM

Wire EDM uses electrical discharges to cut any conductive materials (brass, steel, aluminium even tungsten carbide) with no mechanical forces, enabling high precision, deep cuts, and machining of hard or delicate materials without deformation. 
This project demonstrates how to build a DIY wire EDM machine using salvaged components from an old 3D printer and other affordable parts, keeping the total cost around 150€ + the ender 3 and less than 30h of work.

The machine's frame and motion system leverage the hardware of the Ender 3,  with 1:51 gear reductions on the X and Y axes to enable extremely slow and precise movements required for EDM. 
A Raspberry Pi Pico clone with a TC4428 and a powerful MOSFET are used to switch up to 10A at 50KHz

This project includes guidance on generating toolpaths using a modified post processor from Fusion 360
Depending on the availability of tools and salvaged materials, replication costs may vary slightly. This project took me a few hundreds of hours of developpment but you should be able to replicate in less than 30h.

# Arc generator

It's actually pretty easy to make an arc for EDM, it won't be as powerfull as a commercial machine but pretty close. We just need to switch a powerfull MOSFET on and of very fast, I use the IRF135B203 wich can handle 135V 129A and 500A peak, It works with a cheaper one (IRFZ44N) but it will be less reliable. The mosfet is drived by a TC4428 with a schotcky diode to protect the IC a square pwm signal is generated by the pi pico.

During EDM process, the arc is vaporazing the metal we want to cut and also the wire, so the wire need to be replaced constantly. The easyest and cheapset way to do that is to use the extruder from the ender 3D with a custom aluminium mount as well as the driver from the motherboard. I've tried to modify the firmware to controll it independently but I didn't knew how, so I've cutted the traces on the motheroard and solder some wires between the driver and the pico.

# Power managment 

The power supply should be able to deliver at least 5A with a minium voltage of ~40V, 70-80V make cleaner cuts and are pretty standard in the industry so it's up to you. I personnally use a 48V SMPS, 50V is the limit to be considered safe if accidently touched in the EU but I will probably increase the voltage later.

As soon as the arc is forming, the voltage decrease and the current increase, to protect the PSU, we need to limit the current with some power resistor, I have a 10ohm 100W resistor mounted on a waterblock to limit the current to 5A when the voltage is maximum.

Last part is the capacitors, it helps deliver high current durring short amount of time. You can't use some standard electrolitic capacitor (belive me I tried) ceramic or polymer are a good option, they don't care being shorted be they need to be cool in order to function properly, you can use the same waterblock as for the resistor.

# Mecanical parts

## Motion
Wire edm is a slow process but the minimum speed achivable on an ender 3 is about 1mm/s, we need to be able to move bewteen 0.5-100mm/min in function of the thickness and metall. I've founded 1:51 reducer for around 15€ which can be mounted directly on a nema 17, a printed gearbox have too much backlash for this application so I've also designed a belt reducer of 1:64 which cost 4€ to build.

# Printed part list


| Part | Quantity | Cost |
|- | - | - |
| Arduino uno + CNC shield + DRV8825  | 1 | 15€ |
| M3 * 10mm screws | 100 | 4€ |
| M3 * 8mm screws| 50 | 2€ |
| Linear rail MGN12H 300mm | 4 | 60€ |
| Linear rail MGN12H 150mm | 2 | 20€ |
| Total | a lot | 327€ |

In addition you need to find something to build the base on like aluminium extrusion, if you can found from second hand it can cost something like 40€ otherwise it's more like 80€. Even if it looks stiff 2020 extrusion from 3D printer can bend en vibrate with this type of machine so I'll recommand to use at least 30mm thick aluminuim extrusion.
You will also need 8mm thick aluminium plate about 200 * 200mm again if you can found some from second hand it can be really cheap.
T nut for aluminium extrusion could be added to the list (to fix the linear rails) but it's quite expensive and there isn't much load in this direction so i've 3D printed my own and add m3 inserts

Some more commun supply are also needed like heat shrink tube, solder, wires (I use wires from old RJ45 cable it can handle something like 5A without a problem, its free nd easly accessible).

A lots of tools are needed to work properly:

- Soldering iron
- Drill press
- Caliper
- Dial indicator
- Heat gun
- A good square rule
- Handed metal saw 
- Metal band saw (if your alumiun extrusions needed to be with a perfect 90° angle)
- Hand drill
- Center punch
- Marker for metal
- Hammer, clamps, screw drivers others hand tools
- 3D printer
- deburr tool
