# WireEDM

Wire EDM uses electrical discharges to cut any conductive materials (brass, steel, aluminium even tungsten carbide) with no mechanical forces, enabling high precision, deep cuts, and machining of hard or delicate materials without deformation. 
This project demonstrates how to build a DIY wire EDM machine using salvaged components from an old 3D printer and other affordable parts, keeping the total cost around 100â‚¬ + the ender 3 and less than 30h of work.

The machine's frame and motion system leverage the hardware of the Ender 3,  with 1:51 gear reductions on the X and Y axes to enable extremely slow and precise movements required for EDM. 
A Raspberry Pi Pico clone with a TC4428 and a powerful MOSFET are used to switch up to 10A at 50KHz

This project includes guidance on generating toolpaths using a modified post processor from Fusion 360
Depending on the availability of tools and salvaged materials, replication costs may vary slightly. This project took me a few hundreds of hours of developpment but you should be able to replicate in less than 30h.
